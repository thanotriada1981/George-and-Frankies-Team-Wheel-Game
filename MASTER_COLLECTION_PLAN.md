# 🎯 MASTER NBA DATA COLLECTION PLAN

## 📊 **Current Status Overview**

### NBA 2K25 Official Ratings: 1/30 teams ✅
- ✅ Atlanta Hawks (complete)
- 🚧 29 teams remaining

### Current NBA Rosters: 1/30 teams ✅  
- ✅ Los Angeles Lakers (template)
- 🚧 29 teams remaining

**Total Teams to Collect: 58 data files**

---

## 🚀 **EFFICIENT COLLECTION STRATEGY**

### 💡 **Smart Approach: Collect Both Data Types Per Team**
Instead of collecting all NBA 2K data first, then all roster data, we'll collect BOTH types of data for each team in one session. This is more efficient because:

- ✅ You're already focused on one team
- ✅ Less context switching between systems
- ✅ Can immediately test team in game with complete data
- ✅ Easier to track progress per team
- ✅ More satisfying to complete teams fully
