Our first rule is that I am not a computer programmer or software developer. 
Our second rule is that we want to keep our files organized in a simple way. Do not create too many folders and too many scripts to make this program easy to read and efficient.
Our third rule is to constantly create summaries of our program and display these summaries in an easy to read format, outlining the structure and purpose of this program. 
These rules should always be applied when thinking and acting on this project.
