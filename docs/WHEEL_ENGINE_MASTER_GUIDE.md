# 🏆 MASTER WHEEL ENGINE - FOUNDATION GUIDE

## 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED!
**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY

## 🔧 THE CRITICAL FIX

### Problem
Visual wheel position didn't match selected team in popup/text results.

### Root Cause
**WRONG ROTATION CALCULATION:**
```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN (what we had before)
const rotationNeeded = teamCenterDegree;
```

### Solution
**CORRECT ROTATION CALCULATION:**
```javascript
// ✅ WORKING (the fix)
const rotationNeeded = (360 - teamCenterDegree) % 360;
```

### Why This Works
- **Team at 294°** needs to rotate **66°** clockwise to reach arrow at 0°
- **Formula:** `(360° - 294°) = 66°`
- **Result:** Team perfectly aligns with arrow! 🎯

## 🎯 PROVEN WHEEL ENGINE FEATURES

### ✅ Core Components
1. **Lookup Table Method** - Maps degree ranges to teams
2. **Fixed Arrow Position** - Always at 0° (top of wheel)
3. **Perfect Rotation Math** - `(360 - teamCenter) % 360`
4. **Visual Highlighting** - Golden glow on selected team
5. **Sound Effects** - Audio feedback on completion
6. **Reset System** - Wheel resets to 0° before each spin

### ✅ Animation Details
- **Duration:** 4 seconds
- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.44, -0.205, 0, 1.13)`
- **Rotations:** 7200° (20 full spins) + alignment rotation
- **Highlighting:** 8-second golden pulse effect

## 🔄 REPLICATION GUIDE FOR OTHER SPORTS

### Step 1: Calculate Degrees Per Team
```javascript
// NBA: 30 teams = 360° ÷ 30 = 12° per team
// NFL: 32 teams = 360° ÷ 32 = 11.25° per team  
// MLB: 30 teams = 360° ÷ 30 = 12° per team
const degreesPerTeam = 360 / numberOfTeams;
```

### Step 2: Build Lookup Table
```javascript
function buildTeamLookupTable(teams) {
    return teams.map((team, index) => ({
        teamName: team.name,
        teamId: team.id,
        index: index,
        minDegree: index * degreesPerTeam,
        maxDegree: (index + 1) * degreesPerTeam,
        logo: team.logo,
        colors: team.colors
    }));
}
```

### Step 3: Use Proven Rotation Formula
```javascript
function calculateRotation(teamCenterDegree) {
    // ✅ CRITICAL: This formula MUST be preserved!
    return (360 - teamCenterDegree) % 360;
}
```

### Step 4: Follow Spin Sequence
1. **Reset** wheel to 0°
2. **Calculate** winning team and rotation
3. **Animate** with proven timing
4. **Highlight** selected team
5. **Play** completion sound
