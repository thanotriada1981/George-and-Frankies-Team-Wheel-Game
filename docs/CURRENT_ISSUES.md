## 🔴 **PRIMARY ISSUE: Online Version Not Working**

### **Problem Description:**
- **Local version (localhost:8080)**: ✅ **Working perfectly**
- **Vercel online version**: ❌ **Not working properly**

### **What We've Tried:**
1. ✅ **Fixed initial game state** - Changed from 'setup' to 'classic' mode
2. ✅ **Made mobile interface default** - Both versions should show same layout
3. ✅ **Deployed multiple times** to Vercel with latest changes
4. ✅ **Updated CSS** for consistent mobile-first design
5. ✅ **Removed media queries** that caused desktop vs mobile differences

### **Current URLs:**
- **Local (working)**: `http://localhost:8080/`
- **Vercel (problematic)**: `https://nba-team-wheel-k02x6jr76-thano-triadafilopoulos-projects.vercel.app`

### **Symptoms:**
- Vercel version may still be showing setup phase instead of classic mode
- Possible differences in interface layout between local and online
- User reports "this is still not working online"

### **Next Steps to Try:**
1. 🔍 **Check deployment logs** for errors
2. 🔍 **Compare actual display** of both versions side by side
3. 🔧 **Force cache clear** on Vercel deployment
4. 🔧 **Check if file paths** are working correctly on Vercel
5. 🔧 **Verify JavaScript initialization** runs correctly online

### **Technical Details:**
- **Git status**: Clean, all changes committed
- **Latest commit**: Mobile interface default for both versions
- **Deployment time**: ~6 minutes ago
- **Build status**: Production ready

## 📝 **Notes for Future Debugging:**
- Local version consistently works, suggesting code is correct
- Issue appears to be Vercel-specific deployment or caching problem
- Mobile interface changes were applied but may not be reflecting online
- Need to investigate why Vercel behaves differently than localhost
